still needs to be faster. maybe separate selection box from board entirely? same for tiles? the
board itself basically never needs to rerender right? but having the coordinates is convenient.

bug: can't drag tiles that have the 'selected' box over them

add instructions so someone can test it and know what's going on

ungrossify everything

maybe add word validation stuff

make it pretty
